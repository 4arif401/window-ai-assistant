    "ai": "`System.out.println` is a method in Java that writes the output to the standard output stream and then advances a line cursor. It is commonly used for printing textual output in console applications or to debug during development. The `println` part stands for print line, which means it adds a newline character at the end of the output. For example, `System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");` will display \"Hello World!\" followed by a newline character on the standard output."
